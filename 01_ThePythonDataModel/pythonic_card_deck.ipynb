    "This example shows the power of implementing just three special methods in a user-defined Python class: \\_\\_init\\_\\_, \\_\\_len\\_\\_, and \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_. These methods are also known as _dunder_ (<i>d</i>ouble-<i>under</i>score) methods. They are called by the Python intepreter under certain circumstances and allow any class to behave like a builtin type.\n",
